// Moved out of `apps/be-01/src/service/` on 2026-09-02. Both were already pure —
// neither imported anything at all — and both answer questions about a plan's
// shape rather than about storage: what number a work item takes from where it
// sits, and where a new sibling goes. `schedule.ts` reads the first of them.
export * from './derive-numbers';
// `effective-label` is deliberately absent: it is the walk the three dimensions
// share, not a fourth thing to read a plan with.
