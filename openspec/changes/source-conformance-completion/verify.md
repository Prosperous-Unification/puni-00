# Source conformance completion verification

## 2026-09-12 — task 1.1 execution-aware certification infrastructure

Task 1.1 adds the closed nineteen-family manifest, exact admission-specific
history cases, typed capability declarations, lifecycle-owned execution and
terminal exact-set certification. The four existing source kits remain on the
legacy runner until task 1.3 moves their bodies.

### Explicitly not run in task 1.1

- The full h2puni workspace gate, full source test targets, browser tests and
  builds are deferred to the integrated task 7.3 gate; this slice changes only
  the conformance library and exercised both current source consumers directly.
- New `store-*:test:conformance` targets do not exist yet; task 7.2 owns them.
- No later store-family bodies, broken-source helpers or source-specific fault
  controls were implemented; tasks 1.2 onward own those changes.

One command is explicitly invalid evidence: `bun test src` was accidentally
invoked from the repository root after a formatting pass. Bun collected
unrelated workspace suites and sandboxed listener tests failed on `EPERM`. The
process ended; the command was replaced by the scoped `conformance:test` target
and is not counted above.

## 2026-09-12 — task 1.1 round-one certification corrections

The execution state is now a discriminated union: unexecuted cases cannot carry
started lifecycle evidence, while a pass requires a fixture identity, start and
end timing, and completed cleanup. Certification validates those relationships
again at runtime and verifies that a passed case's registration had an
`openAndRun` body. Assertion failure detection uses a separate caught flag so a
legal `Promise.reject(undefined)` cannot collide with the absence sentinel.

| Undefined rejection is still an assertion failure     | Restored `assertionFailure !== undefined` as the caught sentinel                                 | `an undefined assertion rejection fails after cleanup and cannot certify` | Expected `failed cases ... (assertion: undefined)`; certification did not throw.                               |
| Cleanup does not erase an undefined assertion reason  | Restored the same sentinel while cleanup also rejected                                           | `an undefined assertion rejection is retained when cleanup also fails`    | Expected `undefined; cleanup failed: injected close failure`; received only `cleanup: injected close failure`. |
| Declaration metadata cannot be relabeled as a pass    | Removed runtime execution-evidence validation after changing only `incomplete` to `passed`       | `refuses a declaration-only case relabeled as passed`                     | Expected `invalid execution evidence`; certification did not throw.                                            |
| A pass carries lifecycle identity and timing          | Removed runtime execution-evidence validation from a passed record without fixture/timing fields | `refuses a passed case with missing lifecycle evidence`                   | Expected `invalid execution evidence`; certification did not throw.                                            |
| Passed evidence requires an invoked registration body | Removed the registration-body check while retaining an untouched passed report                   | `refuses passed evidence paired with a declaration-only registration`     | Expected `invalid execution evidence`; certification did not throw.                                            |
| Pass is assigned only after cleanup                   | Removed runtime execution-evidence validation after changing completed phase to `assertion`      | `refuses a pass recorded before successful cleanup`                       | Expected `invalid execution evidence`; certification did not throw.                                            |

### Passing correction commands

- `NX_DAEMON=false NX_ISOLATE_PLUGINS=false bunx nx run conformance:typecheck --skip-nx-cache`: success; the existing missing-family compile fixture remains active.

The Task 1.1 scope skips recorded above remain unchanged for this correction.
