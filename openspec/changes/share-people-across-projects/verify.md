# verify — share-people-across-projects

## Slice 0 — spec

Written on `batch-9/010-4-16-capacity-spec` from main `4bb71e5f`. The change name, the four
capabilities and the ADR follow the design memo's §8 slice 0. The ADR number is 0034 because
the spaces lane holds 0033. No migration ships in slices 0–1.

## Slice 1 — load backend

On `batch-9/010-4-16-capacity-load-view`, stacked on the spec branch. Backend only: the memo puts
the load page in slice 2. `SCHEDULER_CONTRACT_VERSION` is unchanged at 14. There is no
migration.

## Failure proofs

Each fault was injected into the production file, the named test was watched failing, and the
fault was reverted (2026-09-29).

The memo proof runs on the production composition (`OrganizationHarness.openComposed`), where
commands advance the real event sequence.
