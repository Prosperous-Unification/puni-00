# Verify — dash-host-jobs

## Slice 1

Branch `feat/dash-host-jobs-1-catalogue`, from `plan/dash-host-jobs` at `39af9f692`. Local
worktree on the laptop; no h2puni gate was run for this slice (the plan reaches main through
one gate later, task 0.1).

### Assumptions

Each is overrulable by id, like J1 to J18.

- **S1-A1 Shape placement.** The pure `JobType` / Job envelope contract and `parseJobCatalogue`
  live in `@twilight-burokrat/contracts` (`contracts/job-catalogue.ts`), the facade Twilight Dash
  already imports for plan and progress records. Burokrat's rule reads it; Dash will admit from
  it; neither imports the other's runtime. A new `libs/shared/domain/` library was rejected: the
  contract is Twilight-suite vocabulary, not shared by WBS.
- **S1-A2 File shape.** `{ "schemaVersion": 1, "jobs": [ … ] }`, entries exactly as J2 shows.
  Calibrated provenance is `{ kind, hostClass, calibratedAt, recordCount, p95: { cpuCores,
memoryGib, tmpDiskGib }, recordIds }` with as many unique ids as the count. The shape does not
  enforce J9's three-record minimum; that stays `ops job propose`'s provisional refusal.
- **S1-A3 Argument profile grammar.** Space-separated tokens matched one to one with the
  arguments after the entrypoint: literal tokens or `<sha>` (a full 40- or 64-hex commit id);
  `""` takes none; no optional token, because J9 partitions measurements by profile.
  `parseJobArguments(jobType, args)` throws naming type, profile and arguments; Dash maps it to
  exit 64 in slice 2.
- **S1-A4 Package-script entrypoint.** `test-queued`'s entrypoint is
  `package.json#scripts.test:queued`: a JSON file and a dotted key path. The rule requires the
  file and a string at that key. JSON holds no comment, so that entrypoint carries none.
- **S1-A5 Profiles per type.** `gate` `<sha>` (J15's outer launcher resolves it);
  `release-build` `""` (the runbook call; tier arguments would be another profile);
  `test-queued` `""`; `solver-image-publish` `<sha>`, the source revision `publish` builds.
- **S1-A6 Estimates.** `release-build` and `solver-image-publish` share the
  `wbs-dagger-engine` container (fixed name and port 8081), so both name exclusive unit
  `dagger_engine` and declare its bound `{ memoryGib: 8, cpuCores: 6 }` from tool-dagger's
  `--memory=8g --cpus=6`. `test-queued` declares `{ 1, 1 }` like the gate, because
  `tool-remote-scripts:test:caddy` starts a Caddy container; that container is unbounded
  today, which the basis says (task 6.2 bounds it). Every basis states read-not-measured.
- **S1-A7 Expiry instant.** An `until` date is valid through its last UTC millisecond, as
  `inspect-manual` reads a deadline date: `2026-12-01T23:59:59.999Z` passes,
  `2026-12-02T00:00:00.000Z` fails.
- **S1-A8 How the instant arrives.** `check` gains `--now <UTC instant>` (parsed by the
  existing `readEvaluationInstant`), carried as `RuleContext.evaluatedAt`; the rule declares
  input `invocation.evaluatedAt`. `--now` without a dated rule selected is refused, as
  Performance evidence without PERF-THRESHOLD is.
- **S1-A9 Absent catalogue and absent instant.** A candidate with no `infra/jobs/catalogue.json`
  declares no host jobs: observed, no findings (other consumers of the package have none). A
  candidate with a catalogue and no `--now` leaves the rule unevaluated, so a full `check` of
  this repository without `--now` is not allowed, as it already is not without Performance
  evidence.
- **S1-A10 Findings, not refusals to evaluate.** Undecodable, non-JSON, non-regular or
  malformed-header catalogues are findings on the candidate; an unreadable blob is
  unevaluated.
- **S1-A11 Containers finding.** ArkType errors whose path starts at `containers` become the
  "neither none nor a bound" finding; the entry's other errors become one malformed-entry
  finding.
- **S1-A12 Task 1.1 left open.** The `puni-pr-00` companion catalogue with `website-dev-build`
  is outside this slice's brief, so 1.1 stays unticked; everything else in 1.1 is done. The
  glossary terms of 1.3 were already in `docs/twilight-structure/CONTEXT.md`.
- **S1-A13 No module index for `infra/jobs`.** No module index covers `infra/`; the README is
  a plain document, linked from the Burokrat README.

### Commands and results

Run 2026-11-01 on the laptop (load average 6 to 12, a peer worker's tests sharing it), with
`CLAUDECODE` and `CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT` unset for every test run. Outputs trimmed.

### Fault injection

Each fault was applied by a scratch script, the named test file run with
`bun test <file> --timeout=60000` (CLAUDECODE unset), and the source restored.

### Skipped or unverified

- `tool-devsync:test` failed one case,
  `Performance level target production boundary > refuses a dirty, committed or content-masked
checkout after execution`: `Received: "Error: Performance supervisor exited 143"` at its own
  40-second budget. It fails the same way on the base `39af9f692` with none of this slice's
  changes (run alone with `-t`, 40043 ms, same 143), so it is not caused by this slice; it is
  unverified whether it is load on this laptop or a real defect. CI and the h2puni gate decide.
- No h2puni gate and no CI run: this PR targets `plan/dash-host-jobs`, which reaches main
  through one gate later.
- `tool-devsync:lint` and `twilight-burokrat:lint` (the diagnostic wiki lint) were not run;
  lefthook's `lint` passed on each commit.
- The `puni-pr-00` companion catalogue (`website-dev-build`) is not part of this slice (S1-A12).
- Every envelope is an estimate read from scripts, not a measurement; slice 6.4 calibrates.

### Review fixes (Fable, PR #806, MERGE AFTER FIXES)

1. `docs/platform-map.md` says 15 rules in both places.
2. A `check` verdict now records `evaluatedAt` (ISO) when `--now` is supplied. This is additive,
   and `schemaVersion` stays 1.
3. `entrypointIsPresent` reads the blob outside the parse `try`. A missing blob makes the rule
   unevaluated; a non-UTF-8 or unparseable JSON entrypoint is still absent.
4. The spec scenario reads "passes with no finding and no unevaluated rule".
5. The last-millisecond case also asserts exit 0 and `unevaluated: []`.
6. `src/architecture/job-catalogue.architecture.test.ts` is mapped in
   `architecture-fixtures.json`. Its production negative is the 2026-12-02 case.
7. The containers bases name every container the suites start. One reviewer item was not
   adopted: the swap preflight (`swap-mcp-preflight.db.test.ts`) runs the swap's `docker run`
   script with `sh -c` and starts no container (read 2026-11-01), so it is not listed.
8. `test-queued`'s basis says its exclusive units wait on task 6.2, because one checkout and one
   `.nx` cache are shared.
9. Left as the review asked: the Burokrat README's link to `infra/jobs/README.md` is dead on
   npmjs.com, like its existing ADR links.
10. The rule goes through `evaluateWrapped` like the others. `judgeJobCatalogue` returns
    observations and throws when it cannot judge.

Not in this slice: the scenario "An uncatalogued type" (`ops job run … ` exits 64) belongs to
slices 2 and 3.

## Slice 2 — ledger extension, admission, settlement (tasks 2.1–2.3)

Branch `feat/dash-host-jobs-2-ledger` from `plan/dash-host-jobs` at `39af9f692`, 2026-11-01, on
the 24-core workstation (another worker beside it, load average 9 to 12). Code:
`apps/twilight-structure/twilight-dash/cli/src/resources/{runtime.ts,host-pool.ts}`; tests:
`host-pool.test.ts`, `host-jobs.test.ts`, `host-jobs.model.test.ts` with the fixtures
`host-pool.test.fixture.ts` and `host-job-launcher.test.fixture.ts`.

### Assumptions (open decisions taken per design.md; overrulable by id)

- **A1** Configuration schema 3 is required; schema 2 is refused naming the five fields to add,
  as schema 1 already is. No compatibility shim (no external users).
- **A2** The ledger gains `user_version` 1. A version-0 ledger (the four `dash-resource-cleanup`
  tables, no `user_version`) migrates forward inside `ResourceRuntime.open`, in one
  `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, only when its pinned binding equals the configuration's version-0 fields;
  any other version is refused. No separate migrate command. A pre-slice Dash refuses a
  migrated ledger through its own binding check.
- **A3** The pool mode lives in the ledger (`host_pool.mode`, written `observe` at init), not in
  the configuration, so editing the configuration cannot bypass slice 6's fenced switch.
- **A4** The enrollment identity is the configuration's `enrollmentId`, pinned in the binding.
- **A5** `nproc` and `MemTotal` reach init through a `HostFacts` port (`linuxHostFacts` in
  production) so the spec's 8-core, 15 GiB scenarios run on small CI runners; the refusal is
  also proven against this host's real `/proc/meminfo` and `nproc`.
- **A6** A host job reserves `tmpDiskGib` as disk units (ceiling under `diskUnitBytes`) and one
  workspace slot: its private tmp directory is a managed directory under the root (J7).
- **A7** Every exclusive unit must be the top of a Git work tree; its settlement evidence is
  "no live hold, clean, HEAD at the resting commit recorded at admission". A unit of any other
  kind has no defined evidence and is refused at init.
- **A8** Arrival order is the ticket's `AUTOINCREMENT` sequence, assigned under the write lock;
  the ticket stores `arrived_at` in epoch milliseconds (epoch nanoseconds exceed JavaScript's
  safe integers). Deadlines are epoch milliseconds from the injected wall clock because other
  processes compare them, as the shell lock's tickets carry epoch seconds.
- **A9** A ticket is live while its waiter's full identity (pid, boot, start) is alive, which is
  stronger than the lock's pid.
- **A10** A job admitted but never launched stays charged (`unknown`) until its launcher is gone
  and the existing 60-second launch grace has passed; the FD gate opens only after the identity
  is persisted, so no identity means no payload ran. This mirrors the runtime's dead-creator
  recovery and is not release on launcher death alone.
- **A11** Host-job events go to a local outbox `host_job_events` in the same transaction as each
  change; the WBS `events` outbox's v1 contract has no `host_job` kind, so slice 5 publishes.
- **A12** Container evidence is a port (`ContainerEvidence`). `watch`'s sweep settles host jobs
  with `declaredContainersOnly`: `containers: none` has nothing to wait for; a declared bound
  stays charged until slice 3 reads Docker.
- **A13** No CLI in this slice: a top-level `pool` command already exists (`pool import`), and
  an `ops` namespace dispatch is more than a few lines; `resources init` initializes the pool.
  `ops pool init|inspect` lands with slice 3.
- **A14** A 75 refusal names waiting tickets ahead and every unreleased job on the host.
- **A15** Slice 3's launcher calls `prepareHostJob`, `recordHostJobLaunch` and
  `recordHostJobExit`; this slice spawns nothing itself.
- **A16** `captureDescendants` and `ownedProcessesAlive` now take a structural `OwnedGroup`, so
  host jobs reuse the worktree runtime's `/proc` and pidfd evidence unchanged.
- **A17** A tree is clean when `git status --porcelain --untracked-files=all` is empty; ignored
  files (a gate tree's `node_modules`) do not block.

### Race model and fault injection

`host-jobs.model.test.ts` runs `fc.asyncModelRun` 60 times (three fixed examples, then random
draws of up to 80 commands) with five contenders, each a real waiter process, over two ledger
connections: arrivals of five types (gate with a tree, build, whole-pool calibration, declared
containers, larger than the host), polls, cancellations, preparations, real payload launches,
payload exits, container stops, clock advances (budget, reclaim minute, launch grace),
settlement sweeps and a waiter crash at each boundary (ticket, admitted, prepared, launched).
Invariants after every command: reservations within `allocatable`, each tree held by at most
one job, no compute release without terminal evidence; the model predicts every poll outcome
and every settled state independently of `chooseWaiter`. The three examples alone reach every
coverage counter (checked with `numRuns: 3`): admitted 9, barrierHeld 2, severalBarriers 4,
treeBound 1, calibration 2, reclaimed 1, budgetRefused 1, waitZeroRefused 1, oversize 1,
surviving 1, neverLaunched 1, released 6. The second test races six Bun launcher processes,
six rounds each, against one ledger file and replays `host_job_events`.

Each fault was injected by exact text replacement (a scratch script outside the repository; test run in
the private namespace, file restored and its digest checked), all against the final code:

Two faults first survived and changed the tests: with 4-core gates the model's cores ran out
before its trees, so dropping the unit check passed; the model's gate is now 2 cores and 4 GiB
and an example drives a third gate onto two held trees. Random draws rarely built a barrier;
the examples now build two and show the oldest applying.

### Review fixes (Fable, PR #804, MERGE AFTER FIXES)

What changed:

- **S1 (blocking).** A wait-zero ticket's deadline is its arrival time. The enqueue's FULL fsync
  already puts that in the past, so the "budget spent" branch refused it 75 on an empty pool
  under a real clock. The branch now applies only when `waitSeconds > 0`. A wait-zero ticket is
  decided once: admitted if it fits, else refused 75 by the no-room branch.
- **S2, outbox churn.** A tmp entry that is `blocked` with a deletion intent stays `blocked`; it
  no longer flips back to `held`. Both settlement transactions now write an event only when the
  entries, state or evidence identities change (`settlementOf`). Otherwise they save only the
  retry schedule.
- **S2, R5 proofs.** Added `Proof:` comments on the refusals that were tested but uncommented.
  Added tests for:
  - both `tmpIntent` blocked branches;
  - a replaced tmp directory or a symlink in its place;
  - version-0 unexpected tables;
  - the duplicate exclusive id;
  - the prepare, launch and exit seam guards;
  - an unreadable pool mode;
  - one table-driven test for the pool-shape refusals;
  - the init unit refusals: not a directory, an inode duplicate through a real bind mount
    inside the namespace, dirty, held.
- **S3.**
  - Init refuses a dirty or held unit.
  - Admission hands out only a ready unit: readable and clean, with its HEAD read in the same
    transaction. A dirty or broken free unit is not free; the waiting outcome names it
    (`unavailableUnits`) and so does the 75 refusal. A broken unit no longer crashes the
    admitting transaction.
  - `git()` errors now name the subcommand and the tree.
  - Reclaim lines are reported after commit.
  - The 0→1 migration prints one line naming the ledger and the step.
  - A `blocked` job backs off: one second, doubling to a one-minute cap.
  - Model draws are biased: seven contenders, extra gate, build and calibration arrivals, more
    polls. Half the random runs start from a barrier seed (a build held, a calibration waiting,
    two builds past it). The test asserts that random runs form more barriers than the three
    examples do (the examples form 2).
  - The spec scenario "A third gate is overtaken, then barred" now states its pool: 16 cores,
    34 GiB, headroom 0 cores and 2 GiB, two trees. The test always ran on that pool; the first
    scenario's 8-core pool cannot hold two gates and three builds.

New assumptions:

- **A18.** A `blocked` host job uses the worktree cleanup's retry delays (1 s doubling to a 60 s
  cap) but not its six-attempt exhaustion. A blocked tree is resolved by an operator, and no
  retry command exists before slice 3, so exhaustion would strand a resolved tree. `unknown` and
  `held` jobs are still read every tick, because termination must be seen promptly.
- **A19.** Admission checks a free unit's readiness with `git status` and `git rev-parse`, but
  not `inspectHolds`. A full `/proc` scan on every poll was judged too costly. Holds are
  checked at init and at settlement, which is when a unit returns.
- **A20.** The migration line goes to stderr. `ResourceRuntime.open` has no report sink, and
  this happens once per ledger.
- **A21.** The `waiting` outcome gains `unavailableUnits`: the free units that cannot be handed
  out now, each with its reason.

Model counters on one run after the bias: barrierHeld 3–18, severalBarriers 4, barrierFormed
12–15, treeBound 4–30. The examples alone contribute barrierHeld 2, severalBarriers 4,
barrierFormed 2 and treeBound 1.

The baseline flake `unknown surviving child identities stay blocked…` passed inside this run: its namespace wrapper passes only when every inner test does.

`wbs-be-01:typecheck` and `pilot-policy.test.ts` were not rerun: nothing they cover changed in the
review fixes.

### Skipped or unverified

- `tool-devsync` targets: nothing under `tools/tool-devsync` changed, so not run.
- The h2puni gate (`bin/h2puni-gate.sh`) is not run for a slice PR into `plan/dash-host-jobs`;
  task 0.1 schedules it before the plan reaches main.
- Not exercised: a real systemd scope, Docker containers, and real gate launchers (slices 3
  and 6); `ops pool` commands (A13); WBS publication of `host_job_events` (slice 5).
- `be-01`'s `resource-cleanup-smoke.ts` was updated to schema 3 and typechecked, not run (it
  needs a composed be-01 and mcp-01).
- Pre-existing flake: `unknown surviving child identities stay blocked until exact evidence is
restored` (runtime.test.ts) failed once on the untouched base under this host's load (its
  readiness file did not appear within 6 s); see the test run below for its status here.
