## Failure proofs

| Check                                   | Fault injected | Test that observed it | Result  |

## Observations

_(each slice appends its own step-0 baselines, its deltas and the diagnostics it observed here
before handing over. Evidence references are basenames relative to the attempt's evidence
directory.)_

### Slice 1 — 2026-09-22

- Baseline validation items: 112.
- With this change: 113 items, 113 passed and 0 failed, the required baseline plus one.
- Strict validation evidence: `openspec-validation.FeThpd.json`.

### Slice 2 — 2026-09-22

- Domain baseline: 645 passed, 0 failed across 52 files (`slice-2-domain-baseline.log`).
- With `project-ownership.test.ts`: 647 passed, 0 failed across 53 files, the required baseline
  plus two (`slice-2-domain-green.log`).
- Focused ownership test: 2 passed, 0 failed, 3 assertions
  (`slice-2-project-ownership-green.log`).
- Domain unit, lint and type-check targets passed (`slice-2-domain-nx-green.log`).
- The R5 production-path negative belongs to slice 3. Until the six callers use the moved rule,
  forcing it to return `true` has no production path through a service.
