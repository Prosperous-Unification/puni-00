 * cell's own `position: relative` wrapper, opening from the wrapper's bottom
 * edge — which is why the `<td>` it sits in has to be exempt from the grid's
 * `overflow: hidden` (`opensAPopover` in `wbs-table.tsx` is what exempts it;
 * the containing block is inside the clipper, so no styling here can escape
 * it).
 *
 * **A card does not take the pointer.** `pointer-events: none` is the default
 * and it is load-bearing rather than tidy: a card hangs over the row beneath
 * it, and one that takes the mouse eats a click aimed at that row — found in a
 * browser during the fix round, not reasoned about. A card is something to
 * read; the only reason to take the pointer back is content taller than the
 * card, which has to be scrollable to be readable at all, and {@link
 * HoverCardProps.scrolls} is that one exception.
 *
 * No delay, no follow-cursor, no flip-if-clipped: the state that renders one
 * is set on `mouseenter` and cleared on `mouseleave`, and the placement is
 * this and nothing else.
